# My Little Schemer Solutions (Racket with #lang scip)

This is all the code I wrote while working through The Little Schemer by Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen.

I worked through this book to more fully understand recursion and the power of functions.

Everything is within one `.rkt` file as the function build on one another.
